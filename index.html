            The horror of the bombings, the magnitude of the suffering they caused and the arms race that followed suffuse the film. <br> <b> “Oppenheimer”</b> is a great achievement in formal and conceptual terms, and fully absorbing, but Nolan's filmmaking is, <br> crucially, in service to the history that it relates. <br>
            I feel it’s important to mention that I was already quite familiar with Oppenheimer’s story before going into this movie,<br> as I spent a stupid insane amount of time reading more academic history focused books on the atomic age starting from the Curies. <br> Anyways, this movie is split into two timelines woven together. <br> The one timeline, which is largely in black and white, has Robert Downey Jr. portraying Lewis Strauss in 1959 as he <br> ends up trying to get a position as the U.S. Secretary of Commerce. We learn throughout the movie that was <b>Strauss</b>  <br> is saying throughout this is a warped version of what the movie presents as the truth; he essentially set <br> <strong>Oppenheimer</strong> up to lose his job and position due to the fact his beliefs conflicted with Strauss, who believed <br> that we needed to use the hydrogen bomb on the Soviet Union if the time came for it. 
            The other timeline begins with Oppenheimer’s <br> academic journey. He begins in London, where he struggles every night with the content he’s going over. He then goes to <br> Germany after an encounter with Bohr, who gives him some advice.
